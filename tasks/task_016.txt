# Task ID: 16
# Title: Create Reusable Loading and Error State Management Hooks
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop custom React hooks and/or context providers to centralize loading and error state management across the frontend application.
# Details:
Implement a set of reusable hooks and/or context providers that handle common loading and error states throughout the application. This should include:

1. Create a `useLoading` hook that provides:
   - A boolean loading state
   - Functions to set/clear loading state
   - Optional timeout handling for long-running operations

2. Create a `useError` hook that provides:
   - Error object/message storage
   - Functions to set/clear errors
   - Optional error categorization (network, validation, etc.)

3. Create a combined `useAsync` hook that wraps async operations and manages both loading and error states automatically

4. Implement a LoadingContext and ErrorContext with corresponding providers if component hierarchies need shared access to these states

5. Create reusable UI components that consume these hooks/contexts:
   - LoadingIndicator component
   - ErrorMessage component
   - AsyncButton component that handles its own loading state

6. Document usage patterns with examples for the development team

7. Refactor at least 2-3 existing components to use the new hooks/context as proof of concept

Ensure the implementation is TypeScript-friendly with proper type definitions for all hooks, contexts, and their return values.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the functionality and reusability of the hooks/context:

1. Unit tests for each hook:
   - Test `useLoading` hook initializes with correct default state
   - Test setting and clearing loading state works correctly
   - Test timeout functionality if implemented
   - Test `useError` hook captures and clears errors properly
   - Test `useAsync` hook handles promises correctly in success and failure scenarios

2. Integration tests:
   - Test hooks with actual API calls (or mocked responses)
   - Verify loading states display and hide at appropriate times
   - Verify error messages appear correctly when API calls fail

3. Component tests:
   - Test UI components that consume the hooks render correctly in different states
   - Test that error boundaries work with the error handling system

4. Reusability validation:
   - Implement the hooks in 2-3 different components with different requirements
   - Verify consistent behavior across implementations
   - Check for any memory leaks using React DevTools

5. Performance testing:
   - Ensure hooks don't cause unnecessary re-renders
   - Verify context providers are optimized with memoization where appropriate
