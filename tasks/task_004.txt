# Task ID: 4
# Title: Backend API: Update and Delete Endpoints
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the PUT /logs/:id and DELETE /logs/:id API endpoints for updating and deleting log entries.
# Details:
Extend the logs.ts routes file to include PUT /logs/:id endpoint that updates an existing entry. Implement the DELETE /logs/:id endpoint to remove entries. Add validation to ensure the entry exists before updating/deleting. Return appropriate status codes and error messages. Implement parameter validation to prevent SQL injection.

# Test Strategy:
Test updating entries with valid and invalid data. Verify that entries can be deleted and that appropriate error responses are returned when attempting to modify non-existent entries.
