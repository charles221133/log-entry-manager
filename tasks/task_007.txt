# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the form for creating and updating log entries with validation.
# Details:
Create a form component with fields for userName, description, eventDate, and location. Implement form validation for required fields. Add state management for form data using React hooks. Create both create and edit modes for the form. Style the form for desktop and mobile views. Implement form submission handling that calls the appropriate API service function.

# Test Strategy:
Test form validation with valid and invalid inputs. Verify that the form can be used to create new entries and edit existing ones. Test form responsiveness on different screen sizes.
