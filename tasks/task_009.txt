# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Automatic Name Fill Feature
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Add functionality to remember and auto-fill the user's name after the first entry.
# Details:
Use localStorage to save the user's name after the first form submission. Implement logic to pre-fill the name field in the form when creating new entries. Add the ability for users to change the pre-filled name if needed. Ensure the name is only saved after a successful form submission.

# Test Strategy:
Test the name auto-fill by creating an entry and then opening the form for a new entry. Verify that the name is pre-filled and can be changed if needed.
