# Task ID: 19
# Title: Refactor Backend Test Code to Replace 'any' Types and Type Assertions with Proper TypeScript Types
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve type safety in backend test code by replacing all instances of 'any' type and type assertions with proper TypeScript types or type guards, particularly for database query results.
# Details:
This task involves systematically refactoring backend test code to eliminate unsafe type practices. The developer should:

1. Identify all occurrences of 'any' type usage in test files
2. Find all type assertions (using 'as' keyword or angle-bracket notation)
3. For database query results, create proper interfaces or types that match the expected structure
4. Implement type guards where conditional type checking is needed (e.g., `if (isUserRecord(result)) {...}`)
5. Consider using generics for query functions to maintain type safety
6. Update mock data to conform to the newly defined types
7. Pay special attention to areas where query results are destructured or accessed via property notation
8. Document complex type definitions with JSDoc comments for clarity
9. Ensure that test utility functions are also properly typed
10. Maintain test coverage throughout the refactoring process

This refactoring should not change the functional behavior of tests but will improve code quality, maintainability, and catch potential type-related bugs earlier.

# Test Strategy:
To verify this task has been correctly implemented:

1. Run TypeScript compiler in strict mode to ensure no type errors remain
2. Execute the full test suite to confirm all tests still pass after refactoring
3. Perform code review to verify:
   - No instances of 'any' type remain unless absolutely necessary (document these exceptions)
   - No type assertions remain unless absolutely necessary (document these exceptions)
   - All query result types are properly defined
   - Type guards are implemented correctly
   - Test coverage remains at the same level or higher
4. Create a few test cases with intentionally incorrect types to verify the new type system catches these errors
5. Measure the impact on build time and test execution time to ensure performance hasn't degraded
6. Use a static analysis tool like SonarQube to compare code quality metrics before and after
7. Document any patterns discovered that could be applied to production code
