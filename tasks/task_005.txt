# Task ID: 5
# Title: Frontend: Basic UI Components and Layout
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the core UI components and responsive layout for the application.
# Details:
Create reusable UI components: Header, Footer, LogEntryForm, LogEntryList, and LogEntryItem. Implement a responsive layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox. Set up React Router for navigation if needed. Create a basic theme with CSS variables for consistent styling. Ensure the layout is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices using media queries.

# Test Strategy:
Manually test the UI on different screen sizes. Verify that components render correctly and the layout adjusts appropriately for mobile and desktop views.
