# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling Framework for Backend API
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the API's error handling system to properly categorize and respond with appropriate HTTP status codes while improving error logging with contextual information.
# Details:
Develop a centralized error handling middleware that categorizes errors into three main types:

1. Validation Errors (400):
   - Implement input validation using a schema validation library
   - Return detailed feedback on which fields failed validation and why
   - Structure response with a consistent format: `{error: true, type: 'validation', message: 'Validation failed', details: [...]}`

2. Not Found Errors (404):
   - Create a specific NotFoundError class/type
   - Handle cases for resources that don't exist
   - Include the resource type and identifier in the error response

3. Server Errors (500):
   - Catch unexpected exceptions
   - Hide implementation details from users while providing a reference ID
   - Structure response as `{error: true, type: 'server', message: 'Internal server error', referenceId: 'uuid'}`

For logging improvements:
- Create a structured logging format with timestamps, request IDs, user context (if authenticated)
- Log the complete error stack trace for server errors
- Include request parameters, headers (excluding sensitive data), and route information
- Implement different log levels (error, warn, info) based on error severity
- Ensure logs are machine-parseable for future analysis

The implementation should use try/catch blocks in route handlers or a global error middleware depending on the framework being used.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the correct error responses and proper logging:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Create tests for each error type (validation, not found, server)
   - Mock requests that would trigger each error type
   - Verify the response status code matches the expected code (400, 404, 500)
   - Verify the response body structure follows the defined format
   - Use a mocked logger to verify log entries contain required fields

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test actual API endpoints with invalid data to trigger validation errors
   - Request non-existent resources to verify 404 handling
   - Inject controlled errors to verify 500 error handling
   - Verify error reference IDs in 500 responses match what appears in logs

3. Manual Testing:
   - Use Postman or similar tool to trigger different error conditions
   - Verify log files contain the expected detailed context
   - Check that sensitive information is not exposed in responses or logs

4. Edge Cases:
   - Test with malformed JSON requests
   - Test with missing required headers
   - Test with extremely large payloads
   - Verify proper handling of database connection errors
