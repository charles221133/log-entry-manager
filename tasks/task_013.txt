# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Schema Validation for API Requests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive schema validation for all incoming backend API requests using a validation library. This includes validating data types, formats, and sanitizing input data to prevent security vulnerabilities.
# Details:
Select and integrate a schema validation library (zod or joi recommended) into the backend API request pipeline. For each API endpoint:

1. Define validation schemas that specify expected types, formats, and constraints for all request parameters, query strings, headers, and body data
2. Implement middleware that applies these schemas to incoming requests before they reach route handlers
3. Return standardized error responses (HTTP 400) when validation fails, with clear messages indicating validation issues
4. Sanitize input data to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities
5. Implement custom validators for domain-specific data formats if needed
6. Ensure validation is performant and doesn't significantly impact API response times
7. Document the validation requirements for each endpoint

Considerations:
- Use type inference capabilities if using TypeScript
- Implement nested object validation for complex request bodies
- Add appropriate logging for validation failures
- Consider implementing request coercion for non-critical type mismatches

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both successful validation and proper error handling:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test each validation schema with valid inputs
   - Test each validation schema with invalid inputs (wrong types, formats, missing required fields)
   - Verify error messages are descriptive and helpful

2. Integration tests:
   - Send valid requests to endpoints and verify 2xx responses
   - Send invalid requests with various validation issues and verify 400 responses
   - Test edge cases like empty strings, zero values, and boundary conditions
   - Test with malicious payloads (SQL injection, XSS attempts) to verify sanitization

3. Performance tests:
   - Measure response time difference with and without validation
   - Test with large payloads to ensure validation doesn't cause timeouts

4. Manual testing:
   - Verify error messages are user-friendly and actionable
   - Check that validation is consistent across all API endpoints
