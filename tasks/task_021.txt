# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Centralized Validation and Error Handling Middleware
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extract common validation and error handling logic from backend API routes into reusable middleware and utility functions to reduce code duplication and ensure consistent error responses.
# Details:
Create a middleware architecture that centralizes input validation and error handling across all API routes. This should include:

1. Create a validation middleware factory that can be configured for different routes with specific validation schemas (using libraries like Joi, Yup, or express-validator)
2. Implement a global error handling middleware that catches errors from all routes and formats them consistently
3. Develop utility functions for common validation patterns (e.g., ID validation, pagination parameters, date formats)
4. Create a standardized error response format with appropriate HTTP status codes, error codes, and messages
5. Add support for different types of validation (query params, request body, headers, etc.)
6. Implement custom error classes for different error scenarios (ValidationError, AuthenticationError, NotFoundError, etc.)
7. Add logging integration to capture error details for troubleshooting
8. Ensure the middleware preserves the original error stack traces for debugging
9. Document the new middleware and utilities with JSDoc or similar
10. Refactor at least three existing API routes to use the new middleware

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the functionality and integration of the new middleware:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test each validation utility function with valid and invalid inputs
   - Test error handling middleware with different error types
   - Verify correct status codes and response formats for different error scenarios

2. Integration tests:
   - Create test routes that trigger different validation scenarios
   - Verify that validation errors are properly caught and formatted
   - Test that custom error classes are properly handled
   - Ensure stack traces are preserved in development mode but hidden in production

3. Refactoring verification:
   - Compare response formats before and after refactoring to ensure consistency
   - Measure code reduction in routes after implementing the middleware
   - Verify that all validation rules from original routes are preserved
   - Test edge cases that were previously handled in individual routes

4. Performance testing:
   - Benchmark API response times before and after middleware implementation
   - Ensure the middleware doesn't introduce significant overhead
