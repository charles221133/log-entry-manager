# Task ID: 14
# Title: Refactor Frontend Styling to Use CSS Modules and Improve Mobile Responsiveness
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Migrate all inline styles to CSS modules, styled-components, or a global stylesheet, and implement responsive design using media queries to enhance mobile user experience.
# Details:
This task involves systematically removing all inline styles from the frontend codebase and organizing them into a more maintainable structure. Steps include:

1. Audit the codebase to identify all components with inline styles
2. Decide on the appropriate styling approach for each component:
   - CSS Modules for component-specific styles that need scoping
   - Styled-components for dynamic styling based on props
   - Global stylesheet for common styles and design system elements
3. Create the necessary CSS files or styled-components
4. Migrate styles from inline to the chosen approach, ensuring visual consistency
5. Implement responsive design using media queries with the following breakpoints:
   - Mobile: 320px - 480px
   - Tablet: 481px - 768px
   - Desktop: 769px and above
6. Test each component across different viewport sizes
7. Refactor any hardcoded pixel values to use relative units (rem, em, %) where appropriate
8. Document the styling approach in the project documentation

Considerations:
- Maintain visual consistency throughout the migration
- Use CSS variables for theme colors, spacing, and typography
- Follow BEM or another consistent naming convention if using CSS modules
- Consider implementing a responsive grid system if not already in place

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the visual consistency and responsive behavior of the refactored components:

1. Visual Regression Testing:
   - Use tools like Percy, Chromatic, or Storybook to capture screenshots before and after the refactoring
   - Compare screenshots to ensure no unintended visual changes

2. Responsive Testing:
   - Test all components at the defined breakpoints (320px, 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
   - Verify that layouts adjust appropriately at each breakpoint
   - Check for text overflow, element overlapping, or improper scaling

3. Browser Compatibility Testing:
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verify that styles render consistently across browsers

4. Code Quality Checks:
   - Run linting tools to ensure CSS follows project conventions
   - Verify no inline styles remain (can be automated with ESLint rules)
   - Check for unused CSS classes

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and compare page load times before and after refactoring
   - Check bundle size impact of the styling approach
   - Verify that CSS specificity is properly managed to avoid conflicts

6. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify that responsive layouts maintain proper contrast ratios
   - Ensure text remains readable at all viewport sizes
   - Check that touch targets are appropriately sized on mobile devices
