# Task ID: 18
# Title: Refactor Magic Strings and Hardcoded Values into Constants and Configuration Files
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Replace all magic strings and hardcoded values throughout the codebase with constants or configuration parameters to improve maintainability and flexibility.
# Details:
This task involves systematically identifying and replacing all hardcoded values and magic strings in both frontend and backend code. For the backend:

1. Create a dedicated configuration module or file (e.g., `config.js` or `.env` file) to store all configurable values
2. Replace database connection strings, file paths, and table/field names with constants
3. Move API endpoints, authentication parameters, and service URLs to the configuration
4. Implement environment-specific configurations (dev, test, prod)
5. Use a configuration management library if appropriate (dotenv, config, etc.)

For the frontend:

1. Create a constants file or module to store all string literals and fixed values
2. Replace hardcoded API URLs, field names, and UI text with constants
3. Implement environment-specific configuration for the frontend build process
4. Consider using feature flags for toggling functionality

Ensure all replaced values maintain the same functionality while improving code readability and maintainability. Document all configuration options with clear comments explaining their purpose and valid values.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify that the refactoring maintains identical functionality while improving code quality:

1. Unit tests: Verify that all components using the newly created constants work as expected
2. Integration tests: Ensure that components interact correctly with the new configuration system
3. Environment tests: Validate that the application works correctly across different environments (dev, test, prod)
4. Manual verification: Check that all features function identically to pre-refactor behavior
5. Code review: Perform a thorough review to ensure no hardcoded values remain
6. Configuration validation: Test that invalid configuration values are properly handled
7. Regression testing: Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions
8. Documentation review: Verify that all configuration options are properly documented

Specific test cases should include:
- Testing with different configuration values to ensure they're properly applied
- Verifying error handling when configuration is missing or invalid
- Checking that environment-specific configurations load correctly
