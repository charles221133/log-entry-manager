Create a dedicated configuration module or file (e.g., `config.js` or `.env` file) to store all configurable values\n2. Replace database connection strings, file paths, and table/field names with constants\n3. Move API endpoints, authentication parameters, and service URLs to the configuration\n4. Implement environment-specific configurations (dev, test, prod)\n5. Use a configuration management library if appropriate (dotenv, config, etc.)\n\nFor the frontend:\n\n1. Create a constants file or module to store all string literals and fixed values\n2. Replace hardcoded API URLs, field names, and UI text with constants\n3.

Create a few test cases with intentionally incorrect types to verify the new type system catches these errors\n5. Measure the impact on build time and test execution time to ensure performance hasn't degraded\n6. Use a static analysis tool like SonarQube to compare code quality metrics before and after\n7.
