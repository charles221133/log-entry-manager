# Task ID: 20
# Title: Enhance API Error Response System with Descriptive Messages
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a standardized error response system that provides clear, descriptive error messages for validation failures and resource not found scenarios while ensuring sensitive server information is not exposed.
# Details:
Create a centralized error handling mechanism that categorizes errors and returns appropriate HTTP status codes with descriptive messages. For validation errors (400), include specific field validation failures and formatting requirements. For not found errors (404), clearly indicate which resource was not found and provide guidance on valid identifiers. For server errors (500), return generic messages that don't expose implementation details, stack traces, or sensitive configuration information. Implement a consistent JSON error response structure with fields like 'status', 'message', 'errorCode', and optional 'details' for validation errors. Add logging for all errors with full details for server-side debugging while ensuring these details aren't sent to clients. Consider implementing different verbosity levels for development vs. production environments. Update API documentation to include examples of error responses for each endpoint.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each error category (validation, not found, server errors) to verify correct status codes and message formats are returned. Develop integration tests that trigger various error conditions and validate responses match expected format and content. Perform security testing to ensure sensitive information (database details, file paths, stack traces) is not leaked in any error scenario. Test with invalid inputs, malformed requests, and non-existent resource IDs. Verify error messages are helpful for client developers but don't reveal implementation details. Create a checklist of sensitive information types and verify none appear in responses. Test both development and production environments to ensure appropriate verbosity levels. Have another developer review error messages for clarity and security compliance.
