# Task ID: 15
# Title: Replace Emoji Icon Buttons with Accessible Icon Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Replace all emoji icon buttons in the frontend with accessible icon components from a standard library (Material UI or FontAwesome) and implement proper accessibility features.
# Details:
This task involves identifying all instances where emoji characters are currently used as interactive elements in the UI and replacing them with proper icon components. Steps include:

1. Audit the codebase to identify all emoji buttons/interactive elements
2. Select an appropriate icon library (Material UI or FontAwesome) based on project dependencies
3. Install the chosen library if not already present
4. Replace each emoji with the equivalent icon component
5. Add appropriate aria-labels to all icon buttons (e.g., aria-label="Delete item" instead of just showing a trash icon)
6. Ensure all icon buttons are properly focusable with keyboard navigation
7. Verify that icon buttons have appropriate focus states
8. Implement proper tab order for all interactive elements
9. Add tooltips where appropriate for additional context
10. Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA standards (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
11. Update any related documentation or component stories

Considerations:
- Maintain visual consistency across the application
- Ensure the new icons convey the same meaning as the emojis they replace
- Check for any custom styling that might need to be applied to the new components
- Consider bundle size impact when selecting the icon library

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the visual implementation and accessibility improvements:

1. Visual Testing:
   - Compare screenshots before and after implementation to ensure visual consistency
   - Verify all emojis have been replaced with appropriate icons
   - Check that icons render correctly across different browsers and screen sizes

2. Accessibility Testing:
   - Use automated tools (Axe, Lighthouse, WAVE) to verify accessibility improvements
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS) to ensure icons are properly announced
   - Verify keyboard navigation works for all icon buttons:
     * Tab navigation reaches all interactive elements
     * Focus states are clearly visible
     * Enter/Space activates the buttons
   - Check that all icons have appropriate aria-labels
   - Verify color contrast meets WCAG AA standards

3. Functional Testing:
   - Verify all icon buttons perform the same actions as their emoji predecessors
   - Test with different user roles to ensure functionality is preserved

4. Regression Testing:
   - Run existing test suites to ensure no functionality was broken
   - Check that event handlers are still properly attached to the new components
